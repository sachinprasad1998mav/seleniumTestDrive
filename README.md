This is my repository of my practise of the UI testing done with the Selenium framework with Java programming language.
The required dependencies are added in Maven, so there is no need of installing any jar files.
TO run the testing, please run the testing file in the /test directory.

The aim of the project:
Creating a new FirefoxDriver
accessing amazon website
searches for the search box and enters text stanley cup and clicks submit button
filters the products with only products having ratings 3 stas and more and clicks on the first product
adds the product to cart and enters cart page
suddenly goes to youtube and searches for a cinnamon latte receipe
goes back to amazon cart and deletes the cart and thus ending the testing phase.
